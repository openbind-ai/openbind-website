Introducing **OpenBind:** Accelerating structure-based drug discovery for the twenty-first century.

<!--more-->

The advent of a new generation of protein:ligand structure prediction tools---[AlphaFold3](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/), [RoseTTAFold All-Atom](https://github.com/baker-laboratory/RoseTTAFold-All-Atom), [OpenFold](http://openfold.io), [Chai-1](https://www.chaidiscovery.com/blog/introducing-chai-1), [Boltz-2](https://boltz.bio/), [NeuralPLexer3](https://www.iambic.ai/post/np3-preview), and many others---has set off a firestorm that [holds the potential to reshape the way that small molecule drugs are discovered](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01383-z&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1749405936970166&usg=AOvVaw2MQGntU06d0t4I2a8Ra54k). All of these models are held back by the incredibly limited quantity of protein-ligand complex structures used universally to train these models, resulting in [poor generalization performance](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sc/d3sc04185a) that [dramatically limits their prospective utility](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.03.636309) and ultimately prevents them from driving a revolution in small molecule drug discovery. While it is incredible these methods perform so well given they are trained on what is effectively a mere ~25K high-quality complexes in the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](http://rcsb.org)---the primary open structure repository, [representing 50 years of systematic curation of $23B of research investment](https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/index)---it is difficult to imagine simply waiting another 50 years for structure prediction technology to pass a key inflection point to deliver on its potential. 
While [large pharma companies can draw on internal datasets to bolster predictive utility](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00868-9), this is still inherently limiting in the ability to catalyze the much larger number of small biotechs and academic researchers in harnessing this technology, as well as enabling even large pharma to press into new areas of drug discovery with significant need.  

In parallel, there has been rapid progress in both artifical intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) and physical modeling approaches for the prediction of small molecule ligand binding affinities, but these are held back by the lack of high-quality, consistent public datasets. While databases like [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) hold [~21M total bioactivity measurements](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/explore/activities/), a major challenge is that this data exists in small pools from different laboratories—while intra-laboratory experimental data can be highly consistent, extremely large inter-laboratory variation makes it nearly impossible to usefully combine data for a given target from multiple laboratories. Large, consistent affinity datasets could also be used to augment structure data to significantly improve performance on both protein-ligand structure prediction and affinity prediction, and to guide the creation of large-scale structural self-distillation sets that have been instrumental in driving improvements in protein structure prediction and design.

Unfortunately, federal funders have withdrawn support for blind prospective challenges (such as [D3R](https://drugdesigndata.org/) and [SAMPL](https://samplchallenges.org/))---coupled with the slow cycle times of remaining data-limited blind challenges such as [CASP](https://predictioncenter.org/)---leaving the field with a paralyzing inability to assess the true predictive utility of prospective methods and hindering the speed of their development due to lack of continually renewed sources of data.

OpenBind seeks to address these needs simultaneously in a rapid, cost-effective, and highly coordinated manner to generate timely, extremely high-value open data, open models, and a regular and rapid cadence of blind challenges that will dramatically accelerate the development of the next generation of structure-based drug discovery tools and push this technology past a critical inflection point. 

This project will exploit several key advances that present a new opportunity for generating an incredibly valuable dataset---most notably the ability to use [high-throughput macromolecular crystallography](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html) at the [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/) and forthcoming ability to collect a new protein-lugand sturctral dataset every 8 seconds on the [Diamond-II](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Diamond-II.html) [K04 beamline](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/default/Diamond-II/beamline-updates/flagship-beamlines/K04.html) enabling throughput of up to 50,000 structural datasets/week, automated microliter-scale chemistry to generate crude reaction mixtures that can be directly soaked into protein crystals for crystallography, and new capabilities in nanoliter-scale synthesis enabled by extremely chemical large building block libraries. 

The team behind this effort has proven its ability to execute large projects—including the [$68M NIH-funded AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) antiviral discovery effort](http://asapdiscovery.org) that has resulted in preclinical candidates and large open datasets, and has generated 6% of all X-ray structures deposited in the PDB since it began---and the [$30M ARPA-H funded OpenADMET project](http://openadmet.org) to structurally-enable ADMET predictions. The OpenBind project will be the first time these capabilities have been focused on the generation of large structure and affinity datasets for the explicit purpose of constructing highly accurate protein:ligand structure and affinity models rather than pursuing a drug discovery program, which will make them enormously more effective at data generation.
