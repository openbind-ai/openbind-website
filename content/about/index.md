OpenBind is an ambitious open science initiative designed to transform structure-based drug discovery by generating the largest and most consistent open dataset of protein–ligand complexes and binding affinities ever created. Born from the critical need to overcome data scarcity and heterogeneity that currently limit predictive modeling in drug discovery, OpenBind leverages cutting-edge automation, high-throughput crystallography, and nanoscale chemistry to systematically produce high-quality structural and biochemical data at unprecedented scale.

By dramatically expanding the number of crystallographically determined protein–ligand complexes and pairing them with robust affinity measurements, OpenBind aims to catalyze the next generation of accurate, generalizable machine learning models for protein–ligand structure and affinity prediction. These models will be freely available as extensions of the open-source OpenFold platform, ensuring that both academia and industry can access and benefit from these tools.

OpenBind will also host regular blind challenges to drive methodological progress and validate model performance on undisclosed prospective data, creating a continuous feedback loop between experimental data generation and computational modeling. All data will be released under [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) through trusted public repositories such as the [PDB](http://rcsb.org) and [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/), alongside ML-ready formats in hubs like [PolarisHub](https://polarishub.io/) and the [Therapeutic Data Commons](https://tdcommons.ai/).

OpenBind is powered by a global consortium of experts and institutions, including the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) [Centre for Medicines Discovery](https://www.cmd.ox.ac.uk/), [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html) [XChem](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html), the [Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF)](http://omsf.io), [OpenFold](http://openfold.io), and others---building on the success of large open science projects like [ASAP](http://asapdiscovery.org) and [OpenADMET](http://openadmet.org). Together, we are pushing structure-enabled drug discovery past its critical inflection point.

**OpenBind** is generating foundational structural biology data to power the next era of AI/ML for drug discovery.

Since the advent of [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.google/science/alphafold/), rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for structure-based small molecule drug discovery has resulted in an incredible variety of tools able to predict protein-ligand interactions, including including [AlphaFold3](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/), [RoseTTAFold All-Atom](https://github.com/baker-laboratory/RoseTTAFold-All-Atom), [OpenFold](http://openfold.io), [Chai-1](https://www.chaidiscovery.com/blog/introducing-chai-1), [Boltz-2](https://boltz.bio/), [NeuralPLexer3](https://www.iambic.ai/post/np3-preview), among others.

While these AI/ML tools hold tremenous promise in accelerating early-stage drug discovery, these methods universally require abundant, high-quality structural and affinity data to generalize to new drug targets and chemistries. OpenBind aims to furnish the experimental data needed for this revolution to fluorish.

OpenBind aims to:
* **Double the number of protein-ligand structures in the [Protein Data Bank](http://rcsb.org) in under two years** by leveraging protein (re)design, automated chemistry, and ultra-high-throughput X-ray crystallography---ultimately aiming to produce more than 500,000 structures over 5 years.
* **Pair structures with high-quality binding affinities** through mesoscale, microliter-scale, and dense nanoliter-scale chemistry to map out structure-activity relationships
* **Unlock new targets** through protein (re)design efforts that preserve the active site while redesigning the periphery of the protein to permit robust crystallization
* **Produce high-quality open source / open weights models** for protein-ligand structure and affinity prediction, in partnership with [OpenFold](http://openfold.io)
* **Drive data collection** through iterative active learning cycles in order to collect the most informative data for building highly predictive models
* **Field quarterly blind predictive modeling challenges** to assess progress against open souce baselines and focus the field on overcoming obstacles to

Accelerating structure-based drug discovery for the twenty-first century.

The advent of a new generation of protein:ligand structure prediction tools---[AlphaFold3](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/), [RoseTTAFold All-Atom](https://github.com/baker-laboratory/RoseTTAFold-All-Atom), [OpenFold](http://openfold.io), [Chai-1](https://www.chaidiscovery.com/blog/introducing-chai-1), [Boltz-2](https://boltz.bio/), [NeuralPLexer3](https://www.iambic.ai/post/np3-preview), and many others---has set off a firestorm that [holds the potential to reshape the way that small molecule drugs are discovered](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01383-z&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1749405936970166&usg=AOvVaw2MQGntU06d0t4I2a8Ra54k). All of these models are held back by the incredibly limited quantity of protein-ligand complex structures used universally to train these models, resulting in [poor generalization performance](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sc/d3sc04185a) that [dramatically limits their prospective utility](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.03.636309) and ultimately prevents them from driving a revolution in small molecule drug discovery. While it is incredible these methods perform so well given they are trained on what is effectively a mere ~25K high-quality complexes in the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](http://rcsb.org)---the primary open structure repository, [representing 50 years of systematic curation of $23B of research investment](https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/index)---it is difficult to imagine simply waiting another 50 years for structure prediction technology to pass a key inflection point to deliver on its potential. 
While [large pharma companies can draw on internal datasets to bolster predictive utility](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00868-9), this is still inherently limiting in the ability to catalyze the much larger number of small biotechs and academic researchers in harnessing this technology, as well as enabling even large pharma to press into new areas of drug discovery with significant need.  

In parallel, there has been rapid progress in both artifical intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) and physical modeling approaches for the prediction of small molecule ligand binding affinities, but these are held back by the lack of high-quality, consistent public datasets. While databases like [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) hold [~21M total bioactivity measurements](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/explore/activities/), a major challenge is that this data exists in small pools from different laboratories—while intra-laboratory experimental data can be highly consistent, extremely large inter-laboratory variation makes it nearly impossible to usefully combine data for a given target from multiple laboratories. Large, consistent affinity datasets could also be used to augment structure data to significantly improve performance on both protein-ligand structure prediction and affinity prediction, and to guide the creation of large-scale structural self-distillation sets that have been instrumental in driving improvements in protein structure prediction and design.

Unfortunately, federal funders have withdrawn support for blind prospective challenges (such as D3R and SAMPL)---coupled with the slow cycle times of remaining data-limited blind challenges such as CASP---leaving the field with a paralyzing inability to assess the true predictive utility of prospective methods and hindering the speed of their development due to lack of continually renewed sources of data.

OpenBind seeks to address these needs simultaneously in a rapid, cost-effective, and highly coordinated manner to generate timely, extremely high-value open data, open models, and a regular and rapid cadence of blind challenges that will dramatically accelerate the development of the next generation of structure-based drug discovery tools and push this technology past a critical inflection point. 

This project exploits several key advances that present a new opportunity for generating an incredibly valuable dataset—most notably the ability to collect a new protein:ligand complex X-ray structure every 8 seconds on the Diamond K04 beamline, automated microliter-scale chemistry to generate crude reaction mixtures that can be directly soaked into protein crystals for crystallography, and new capabilities in nanoliter-scale synthesis enabled by extremely chemical large building block libraries (see Key Technologies). 

The team behind this effort has proven its ability to execute large projects—including the $68M NIH-funded AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) antiviral discovery effort that has resulted in preclinical candidates and large open datasets, and has generated 6% of all X-ray structures deposited in the PDB since it began—and the $30M ARPA-H funded OpenADMET project to structurally-enable ADMET predictions. The OpenBind project will be the first time these capabilities have been focused on the generation of large structure and affinity datasets for the explicit purpose of constructing highly accurate protein:ligand structure and affinity models rather than pursuing a drug discovery program, which will make them enormously more effective at data generation.
